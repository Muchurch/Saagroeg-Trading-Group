        <!----------5 Tech Investment Trends to Keep Your Eye On------->
        
        <section class="Money-Matters">
        <div class="row">
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>5 Tech Investment Trends to Keep Your Eye On</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>There are few sectors more exciting – or potentially lucrative – as tech when investing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, since the world of technology is constantly evolving, it can be challenging to know which areas of the expansive tech sector to keep your eye on and invest in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With this in mind, these top 5 tech investment trends currently dominate.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><span>1. Developments in the Metaverse.</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>By 2024, Bloomberg Intelligence predicts that investment in the Metaverse will likely reach $800 billion. Meta – formerly Facebook – has already invested over $10 billion in the concept, and many investors have followed suit.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As the virtual world becomes an even more significant part of our lives – in the form of phenomena such as cryptocurrency and Virtual Reality experiences and gaming – we can only expect this movement to expand in the future as the Metaverse becomes a staple of our real-life world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In particular, the increasing monetisation of digital assets such as NFTs and digital versions of physical goods make the meta-market one with huge potential, mainly since the cost to produce digital assets is significantly lower than their physical counterparts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Powered by blockchain technology – where records of transactions are kept in ledgers designating ownership – we can expect countless businesses to jump on this opportunity, and investors should take note of this future-altering trend.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><span>2. Evolving payment systems.</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>The world of Fintech is growing exponentially as technological advances create new possibilities for the future of finance – especially in the form of new payment systems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over a hundred fintech start-ups have reached unicorn status, showing the vast number of opportunities there have been for finance tech to disrupt the space – and how profitable investing in these start-ups can be for investors since many have become worth billions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In particular, embedded financial services are a massive movement in the world of Fintech currently. It allows non-finance-centred businesses to offer financial services to customers, and these same companies to employ Banking as a Service (BaaS) and embed financial services into their systems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Digital wallets – where digital currency and digital goods such as NFTs are stored – are becoming increasingly prevalent as their use-cases increase and fintech companies expand the range of what they can accomplish with their innovations.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><span>3. Cloud computing and SaaS.</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>Over the last decade, organisations across countless industries have been using cloud-based services and outsourcing to SaaS companies to fulfil their needs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What’s more: as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, global digital transformation sped up rapidly – particular in the world of business – as many people were forced to communicate, work and orchestrate their leisure time in the digital world, leaving us with technologically-enabled world years ahead of its time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This global digital transformation hasn’t slowed post-lockdown, and the use cases for SaaS and cloud computing continues to grow – as do the number of SaaS start-ups and cloud computing tech firms.</p>
            <br>
            <p>McKinsey notes that one of the newest and biggest cloud and edge computing trends is “distributed infrastructure”: a phenomenon allowing companies to operate more remotely, access analytics on demand, and strengthen cybersecurity, among other uses, by moving their computing to the edge of their networks.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><span>4. Robotics & AI.</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>From Electric Vehicles (EVs) to fully-fledged human look-a-likes, AI and robotics are transforming many traditionally human-led tasks and processes, from driving to data processing and analysis.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Tesla believes that human-imitating robots could be the answer to the labour shortage problem in the US and across the world. Conceivably, the robots could step in to complete labour-intensive processes such as assembly, packing, lifting and transportation of goods throughout a building.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Aside from that, EVs – fuelled by artificial intelligence (and electricity, of course) – provide one part of the puzzle piece to the climate solution. As such, they will only become more popular in the future. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Moreover, businesses are rapidly turning to AI to drive their analytics and to make the best data-driven decisions for their business. These are only a few of the many growing uses cases of robotics and AI.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><span>5. M&A is ramping up</span></h3>
            <br>
            <p>As a result of the many exciting developments in tech, the rapid shift towards digital transformation in all aspects of life and the immense potential profitability of tech start-ups, investment banks have taken an increasing interest in the tech world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a result, it’s expected that the number of mergers and acquisitions of tech businesses is set to ramp up, as predicted at Morgan Stanley’s Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) Conference in San Francisco.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Start-ups and SMB tech businesses will likely grasp this opportunity to grow and achieve greater reach more quickly, while M&A firms will acquire and merge the start-ups they believe could be immensely profitable.</p>
