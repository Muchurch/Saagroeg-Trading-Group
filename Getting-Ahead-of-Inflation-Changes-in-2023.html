        <!----------Getting Ahead of Inflation Changes in 2023------->
        
        <section class="Money-Matters">
        <div class="row">
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>Getting Ahead of Inflation Changes in 2023</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>The inflation rate is falling – and that’s a good thing – but what does it mean for our investments?</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2023, we’ll need to make investment decisions considering the uncertain financial climate we’re enduring – considering a number of possible potential futures.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>What will happen to inflation in 2023?</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Thankfully, inflationary pressures are easing, including the cost of energy, which is slowly but surely reducing, while the pressure is lifting from overburdened supply chains.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Though the rate of inflation is falling – that’s for certain – it isn’t yet nearing what we’ve historically considered normal, at around 2%.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Across the globe, the rate of inflation sits between 8-11%, depending on the country, so prices are still increasing significantly more quickly than in previous years, pre-covid. It’s important to remember that falling inflation doesn’t mean prices are reducing – it just means they’re increasing less quickly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What isn’t clear is where inflation will fall to, whether it will slowly return to pre-covid levels or stabilize at a higher rate – or whether the drastic economic change will tip us into recession.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When experts agree that inflation rates will be the most influential variable on investments in 2023, what does this mean for investing?</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>Currently, the valuation of stocks is higher.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>The valuation of stocks at the beginning of this year is higher than at the same time last year – when interest rates were hiked to combat inflation – as stocks escaped the bear market in the latter half of the year.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In terms of both equity and especially fixed-income assets, valuations have risen, with the stock market looking healthier than it has for the last year. Some of the most influential indexes – including the S&P 500 and NASDAQ – are up by several per cent compared to the previous quarter.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, valuations are still lower than we could expect in the more favourable market conditions pre-covid.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>If we head into a recession, the stock market is likely to fall.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Though the stock market is performing better for now, if a recession hits – and trade and industrial activity slows – it’s likely the stock market will take a hit once again, as companies’ sales are hit, and growth slows.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If this happens, some sectors may be better equipped to handle the downturn than others.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sectors such as healthcare, utilities and logistics are more recession-proof than businesses such as those in the retail and leisure/hospitality industries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During a recession, a declining economic activity often leads to less money spent on leisure, experiences and luxuries – so it might be a good idea to steer clear of these sectors when investing in 2023, at least until it becomes clear whether or not we’ll endure a recession.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>Consider diversifying with commodities.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>The price of commodities fell last year due to interest rate hikes and the Ukraine-Russia conflict, which curtailed supply from some of the most important metal and agricultural exporters in eastern Europe and contributed to the energy crisis.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, commodities are performing better at the start of this year. Commodities also have a low correlation to the stock market, so they present a good option for diversifying your portfolio, especially considering the possibility of recession and a stock market tumble.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>Bonds may present the most attractive investments.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>In contrast to the last year’s poorly performing stocks, particularly US savings bonds, have yielded unusually high percentages.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Last year, demand for high-yielding bonds was so great that the US Treasury Direct site crashed on the last day that Series I savings bonds – with a bond rate of almost 10% – were being sold on the site.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While bond rates aren’t as high as the last quarter on average, they’re still offering higher yields than historical ones.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>Investors should look for long-term opportunities.</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>In 2023, the uncertain, potentially volatile financial climate means that long-term investing – rather than short-term trading – represents the best opportunity for maximizing your assets.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The key advice for investors is to make investing choices – especially into stocks, funds and ETFs – carefully and hold out despite short-term market fluctuations and media tattle. By wearing out the small downturns, you’ll be able to watch your investments grow over the decades, despite what 2023 has to bring.</p>
