        <!----------How Much Money Do I Have to Invest for It to Be Worth It?------->
        
        <section class="Money-Matters">
        <div class="row">
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>How Much Money Do I Have to Invest for It to Be Worth It?</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Anyone who wants to strengthen their financial position should know that investing is vital for making the most of your money.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over time, returns from investments typically outperform both inflation and interest rates of savings accounts. Investing enables you to make money from money.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But how much money do you need to invest for it to be worth it? With figures floating around on the web ranging from $1 to $5,000, it’s no wonder you’re looking for answers.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>What’s the minimum you should invest?</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Depending on your investment goals and needs, most financial institutions recommend starting with a minimum of $500. Mainly because of fees associated with purchasing and selling shares, which you would do via an institution that trades on your behalf on the stock exchange.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Fees typically range from $10-25 per trade. Therefore, if you only invest $100 in a company, you can pay up to 25% of your investment’s value on top of your share’s value.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In this case, your investment would have to grow by 50% to break even (considering the broker fee subtracted when both buying and selling the stock).</p>
            <br>
            <p>On the other hand, if you invest $1000, even a high broker fee of $25 would only represent 2.5% of your investment. As such, the value of your share would only have to increase by 5% to break even and start earning a profit.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the past, investing in the stock market wasn’t accessible to everyone – only to those with lump sums of cash readily available.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, this isn’t the case nowadays, with no-fee trading platforms providing investment options for those who can only afford to invest a little at a time. Budding traders can deposit cash into their trading account and start purchasing shares, the value of which should increase over time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For this reason, anyone can begin investing with as little as $1, though to significantly impact your financial position, you should aim for higher.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>Is there a benefit to using brokers over trading platforms?</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>When we hear about ‘no-fee trading,’ it sounds too good to be true.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While trading platforms are a no-brainer for those who can only spare a small amount of capital to invest at a time, it might be worth weighing up both options for those with more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>No-commission trading platforms reap the bulk of their earnings from a concept described as ‘payments for order flow’. Traders pay slightly higher prices for the stocks they buy and similarly sell them for a slightly reduced price, with the trading platform making a profit from the difference.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Suppose you intend to invest significant amounts of capital at once. In that case, it might be worth weighing up whether paying a brokerage fee – or buying and selling stocks at a disadvantaged rate – will detract the most negligible value from your portfolio.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>Is there a minimum amount you should invest?</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Though you can invest with as little as $1 – and it’s still a better idea, in the long term than keeping your capital in a savings account – to make the most from your investments, you should aim for higher. Even $10 a month will grow and make your effort worth it over time, as long as you begin early enough.</p>
            <br>
            <p>You can more significantly influence your financial position by starting early than by waiting and saving until you have a lump sum to invest.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The sooner you begin investing, the more time your investments have to grow – which, on average, they do. When your investments make money, you can also reinvest what you earn and watch this evolve. Over time, this compounding effect can significantly impact your financial position.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Though investing smaller amounts is still worth it, investing $100 each month will incredibly affect your financial position over time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By investing $100 per month for 30 years – assuming a 10% rate of return – your total investment contributions would equal $36k. Still, your portfolio would be worth $228,033 at the end of this period, thanks to the effect of compounding.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2><span>So, how much should you invest?</span></h2>
            <br>
            <p>There’s no limit to how little or much you should invest per month for it to be worth it. After an initial $100 contribution, even a monthly addition of $10 to your investment portfolio can turn $3,600 contributions into over $24k after a 30-year investment period.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, to make a significant difference to your financial position, aiming for a monthly contribution of $100 or more is an achievable goal that can make a massive difference to your finances.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you have the capital to make an even larger initial payment – before beginning your monthly contributions – you should. The more time your investments have to grow, the more profit you’ll earn, and the greater the compounding effect will be.</p>
